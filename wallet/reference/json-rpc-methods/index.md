# JSON-RPC API

This section provides an interactive reference for the JSON-RPC API of MetaMask's [Wallet API](../../concepts/wallet-api.md). The API builds on a set of standard Ethereum methods with MetaMask-specific enhancements, and is designed for seamless integration into dapps.

View the JSON-RPC API methods by selecting a method in the left sidebar. You can test the methods directly in the page using the API playground, with pre-configured examples or custom parameters. You can also save URLs with custom parameters using your browser's bookmarks.
