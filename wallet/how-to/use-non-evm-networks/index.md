# Use non-EVM networks
You can connect to non-EVM networks and interact with users' accounts on these networks using MetaMask Snaps.

## Non-EVM networks

Non-EVM networks are blockchain networks that are not compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

Non-EVM dapps and MetaMask can't directly interact with each other.
By connecting to dedicated non-EVM Snaps, you can extend the functionality of MetaMask and integrate non-EVM networks into your existing MetaMask workflow.
