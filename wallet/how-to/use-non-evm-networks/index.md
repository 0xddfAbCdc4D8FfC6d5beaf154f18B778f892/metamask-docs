# Connect non-EVM wallets to MetaMask using Snaps

## Non-EVM Wallets

Non-EVM wallets are cryptocurrency wallets that operate on blockchain networks not compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). 
Non-EVM wallets can't directly interact with MetaMask or other Ethereum-based applications. 
Use Snaps to connect these wallets to extend their functionality and integrate them with your existing MetaMask workflow.

## MetaMask Snaps

[MetaMask Snaps](../snaps/learn/about-snaps/) extend MetaMask's functionality. It allows MetaMask to connect with [non-EVM networks]((../snaps/features/non-evm-networks/). 

MetaMask Snaps features include:

- **Expanded network support**: Connect to multiple non-EVM networks.
- **Custom functionality**: Add new features to MetaMask.
- **Enhanced security**: Each Snap runs in its own secure environment.

MetaMask Snaps increase interoperability by enabling the use of non-EVM assets with Ethereum-based dapps and provides a unified interface to manage assets in one place.
