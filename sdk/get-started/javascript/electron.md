# Get started using Electron

Import MetaMask SDK into your Electron dapp to enable your users
to easily connect to the MetaMask browser extension and MetaMask Mobile.

On the frontend, see the instructions to [use the SDK with React](react/index.md).
On the backend, see the instructions to [use the SDK with Node.js](nodejs.md).

## Example

See the [example Electron dapp](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-sdk/tree/main/packages/examples/electronjs)
in the JavaScript SDK GitHub repository for more information.
