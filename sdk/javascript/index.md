# MetaMask JavaScript SDK

[MetaMask JavaScript SDK](concepts/about-sdk.md) is a library that provides a reliable, secure, and seamless
connection from your JavaScript dapp to the MetaMask browser extension and MetaMask Mobile.
By integrating your dapp using the SDK, millions of MetaMask Mobile users can connect to their
preferred MetaMask client.
The JavaScript SDK supports the following libraries and environments:
